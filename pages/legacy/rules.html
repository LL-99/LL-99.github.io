<h2>Feats revisited</h2>

<h3>Sentinel</h3>

<p>
    Sentinel is one of the most infamous feats in all of 5e, allowing for some of the most powerful and ridiculous combos (e.g., a tiny Gnome stopping a Red Greatwyrm dead in its tracks as it tries to devour the party's wizard).
    This revision aims to adjust the feat and achieve a more realistic and grounded feel for it while not removing too much of its power or destroying its iconic nature.
</p>

<p>
    You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits.
    - When you hit a creature of equal or lower size with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
    If the creature is exactly one size category larger than you, you may make may compete on a Strength (Athletics) check. If you win the check, this part of the feat also applies against that creature for this opportunity attack.
    - Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
    - Before or after each of your turns, the first time any creature makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you may make a melee opportunity attack against that creature.

<h2>Physical Saving Throws Revised</h2>

<p>
DnD possesses a variety of different saving throws, most of which are against traps, spells or magical effects (as of the writing of this rule over 155 DIFFERENT spells, or almost a third of all spells, require a str, dex or con saving throw).
Almost all of these saving throws have fixed DCs and are strongly defined either by some specific spell/item description or a rulebook (in case of traps).

The following "Physical Saving Throws Revised" rule proposes a way to spice up these saving throws in a meaningful manner.
As the name already suggests, this rule only affects physical saving throws, meaning those utilizing any single (or combination) of strength, dexterity and constitution.
Similar to most rules on this page, "Physical Saving Throws Revised" aims to require minimal effort by the players, shifting a lot of the work to the DM and only requiring them to have fully understood the rule (players should be familiar with it too - of course - but they will not be required to know all details).
</p>

<h4>The rule</h4>
<p>
Any 'save or suck' and 'hit or half' saving throws that use at least one of the abilities strength, dexterity and constituion are divided up into three distinct parts.
While these saving throws usually would possess a "fail zone" and a "success zone", split up by the DC, this rule introduces a secondary DC, optionally also modifying the primary/original DC.
To calculate this new DC, we define a difficulty difference. This value may be anything you like (such as the proficiency bonus of the caster), but I would recommend using a fixed global value, which for the following examples is going to be 5.

The secondary DC (DC2) equals the original DC. If the saving throw in question is a 'hit or half' roll, we also subtract the difficulty difference from it (in our case DC2 = DC - 5).
Any creature subjected to the saving throw will 'pass' the roll if it hits or exceeds the DC2. However, this has two meanings:
1. 'save or suck': A creature that surpasses the DC will gain no ill effects
2. 'hit or half': A creature that surpasses the DC2 will only half the effects. Additionally we utilize our previous original DC and increment it by the difficult difference (in our case DC = DC + 5).
    If the creature also surpasses this throw,

Whenever a creature makes such a saving throw,

<h2>Combat Summary Roll:</h2>
<p>
The Combat Summary Roll intends to sum up and skip otherwise boring long combat periods against vast amounts of enemies, such as full-scale battles between two or more armies.
Going through these battles and combat scenarios RAW would be a slog for all involved and quickly drain party morale,
especially if one considers the actual duration of historical battles which could extend to multiple hours (well upwards of 1,000 rounds in DnD 5e, for instance).
As such the Combat Summary Roll allows the group to summarize the events and outcomings of large time fragments.
Furthermore, the Combat Summary Roll shifts the majority of work to the DM, only requiring the equivalent of a single turn from each player for upwards of 5 minutes of combat time.
While this mechanic does provide a solution for the dice rolling part of large-scale battles, it is still highly dependent on proper flavoring and narration by both the DM and the party.

The actual roll consists of (5e):
- The AC
- An attack or spell attack roll (whichever is higher)
- Additional Actions: If the character has special class features, abilities from feats/magical items, or similar that take an action, bonus action or reaction to activate/use, they may do so.
    Each character gets a single action, bonus action, and reaction per roll.
    Any limitations, such as "You may activate this feature X amount of times before you need a long rest to use it again" or required spell slots apply as usual.
    Abilities are grouped into multiple different categories each counting for a slightly part of the roll, namely:
    - Offensive Modifiers (2): E.g., the (Fighter) Champion's "Improved Critical" feature, as it doubles the default critical strike chance of 5% to 10%.
    - Defensive Modifiers (2): E.g., the (Paladin) Oath of Ancients' "Aura of Warding" feature, which grants resistance to spell damage in a small radius around the character.
    - Utility Modifiers (2): E.g., the Bard's "Bardic Inspiration" feature, which can enhance another a single ability check, attack roll or saving throw of another creature.
    - Special Modifiers (3): E.g., the Barbarian's Rage feature, as it grants defensive and offensive capabilities. Abilities that would fit into multiple categories instead count as Special Modifiers.
    For each used feature of the specific kind, a player adds the described value to their total roll.
    Permanent features, such as a Paladin's Aura effects, should be noted down on the character sheet before a battle begins to save time in the future.
    In case of a character possessing extraordinarily potent features or abilities, the DM might decide grant them an additional bonus on the respective modifier.
- Spell Modifiers: If the character is capable of spellcasting, they may expend 1 additional spell slot to add 1d4 per level of the spell slot to the roll.
- Combat Exhaustion: After every combat segment they participate in, a player character makes a saving throw against a DC of 10 + 3 * amount of previous combat segments.
    On a fail, the character receives 1 level of combat exhaustion.


Their total score is calculated as follows:
AC - 10 + Attack roll + Offensive Modifiers + Defensive Modifiers + Utility Modifiers + Special Modifiers + Spell Modifier - 1d10 per level of combat exhaustion

If multiple PCs fight side by side, their scores may be added to each other.

But what is the roll actually made against?
Simply speaking, the enemy. How the enemy score is determined relies on the DM, but the table below provides a solid assistance.
The following table makes a few assumptions about the rate of NPC Soldiers to player levels:
- Town guard/Recruit: Level 1 - 1d4 + 1
- Simple Soldier: Level 2 - 1d6 + 1
- Trained Soldier: Level 3 - 1d8 + 2
- Veteran Soldier: Level 5 - 2d4 + 2
- Commanders/Special Soldiers: Level 8 - 2d6 + 4

Examples:
- A small troop (6) of recruits sent to the front as meat shields: 6d4 + 6 -> Avg: 21; A considerate challenge for a single mid level character
- A veteran leading his squad (3 trained soldiers): 3d8 + 2d4 + 8 -> 26.5; Pretty easy for a high level combat oriented PC
- A commander followed by his loyal soldiers (4 veterans, 12 simple soldiers): 12d6 + 12 + 8d4 + 8 + 2d6 + 4 -> Avg: 93; Almost impossible to beat for a single PC






Advanced adjustments:
While the Combat Summary Roll captures a large-scale chaotic battlefield, it mostly ignores solder formations, army compositions and the like. 
This is done due to simplicity's sake, but for battles, especially for which the party was involved in strategizing and planning, it might be appropriate to apply additional
modifiers to the various combat rolls based on the individual party member's location, their combat roll, and the enemies they face.

Combat matchups:
    Modifier    Condition
    -1d12       If facing enemy cavalry in melee as non-cavalry
    -1d8        If under enemy archer fire
    -1d8        If under enemy artillery fire

Combat roll:
- Infantry:     Default roll
- Cavalry:      Mount AC, as well as 1d4 per 30ft of mount speed, are added to the combat roll
- Archers:      AC matters only, if the squad is approached by an enemy
- Artillery:    
- Command (frontline):  +1d4 per nearby group of allied troups
- Command (backline):

<h2>Weapon Sizes</h2>

<p>
Inspired by: "Creating a Monster" DMG (p278)

This rule provides an equalized rule for scaling the damage and area of weapons depending on their size (for both monsters and PCs).

Weapons now have their own size property. All player weapons (as listed in the official ruleset) are medium by default.
All monster weapons share the size of their wielder and overwrite the physical damage dice listed in the their statblock. 
Any bonuses from magical effects or other damage dice remain as in the statblock.

A creature may wield any weapon of its own size or smaller as normal, but has disadvantage on attacks when using a weapon one category larger or 
has to succeed on a Athletics Check against 10 + 5 * size difference (still attacking with disadvantage) when the weapon is two or more size categories larger.

However, using large weapons also provides a fundamental bonus to the any attack that hits.
As such, weapon damage dice are multiplied by the size difference to medium + 1. This means a large Longsword will deal 2d8 slashing damage (vs the 1d8 slashing damage by default)
and a huge Maul will deal 6d6 bludgeoning damage (vs the 2d6 bludgeoning damage by default).
Furthermore, attacks with weapons of size huge and above gain additional area of effect. Piercing weapons also hit the creature 5ft. behind the original target,
bludgeoning weapons hit all creatures in a 5ft. radius around the original target (except for the wielder), and slashing weapons also hit creatures directly to the left
or right of the original target (chosen by the attacking creature for each attack). No matter how many creatures are targeted by an attack, the attacking creature only makes
a single attack roll to which each individual targets AC is compared. Consecutively damage is rolled only once. Indirectly targeted creatures take only half damage from the attack
(stacking with resistance where applicable for 25% total damage).

Large weapons may be extremely uncommon depending on the setting, but may be wielded by giants, huge and above fiends/celestials, or similar.
Additionally, if a creature and its gear are affected by a size altering effect (e.g. the spell "Enlarge/Reduce"), their weapons' size categories will also become larger or smaller.

Path of the Ravager
*Note: This subclass is heavily inspired by the Berserker & Zealot paths. It aims to make exhaustion a resource you need to manage, while also allowing you to relentlessy attack.*


Starting at 3rd level, the fire within you grows more intense, drowning out the pain of your aching bones and strained muscles.
If you would gain a level of exhaustion during your Rage, you gain it after your rage ends instead. You can gain any number of levels of exhaustion.
While at 6 or more levels of exhaustion, you do not die outright. Instead, you make death saving throws as if on 0 hit points. Every 3 death saving throws you succeed, remove 1d4 levels of exhaustion from you.
Whenever a level of exhaustion would be removed from you (via any source except for this feature), remove 1d4 additional levels of exhaustion.


At 10th level, you have learned to funnel the immense and constant rage within you into a slow-burning inferno.
Your rage no longer has a time limit on it, but for every minute you spend in it, roll 1d6. On a 1-4 you gain a level of exhaustion.



Calamitious Rage
Starting at 14th level, your wrath allows you carry on far beyond your physical limits - at a price.

While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. 
You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. 
However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.
