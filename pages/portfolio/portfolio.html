                Unsurprisingly, this website was made by me ;)
                <br>
                While I could've used any of the countless visual editors for websites (or used some framework or library like Bootstrap or a proper editor like Google Sites), I wanted to familiarize myself a bit more with web development, so I decided to do all of this myself.
                <br>
                This website may not look as good as a professional company's page, but I can proudly say that I've learned quite a bit about HTML, CSS and JS during the process of making it.
                <br>
                Since you are already on this page screenshots/pictures wouldn't make much sense, however, feel free to check out the page's source code if your browser supports some kind of developer console or <a href="https://github.com/LL-99/LL-99.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directly on GitHub</a>. It's not much, but I'm happy with how it turned out.

                I created this game as part of a self-imposed GameJam-esque challenge in which I attempted to create a full game within a single week. While I was largely successful, there are still some bugs I want to iron out before properly publishing it.
                <br>
                The gameplay is inspired by another project on which I worked during my degree, namely <a href="#project-games-lab">Project: Equilibrium</a>. While the bullet-hell-style core of both games is similar, I wanted to move away from Equilibrium's constantly swapping world state and instead wanted to give the player more control. To achieve this, I focused on an energy-redirection system, which allows the player to empower either their ships offensive, defensive or mobility-based aspects. I originally wanted to add multiple swappable weapons and more complex enemies, however, due to time constraints these features had to be cut. Since I like how the game turned out so far, I may continue working on it as a side-project in the future. A download link will be added here as soon as I publish the game on itch.io or similar.

            <h2 class="caption">Island Generator</h2>
            <p>
                One of the things I always enjoyed most, when it comes to just playing around with Engines capable of 3D rendering was creating environments and particularly the procedural generation of these. Over the years I was able to pick up quite a bit of knowledge, but I never really got to use it during my studies.
                <br>
                At one point I wrote a more complex procedural generation algorithm inspired by 3D sandbox games like Minecraft. So I thought to myself: Why not make something cool out of it? Ultimately, I started working on this small project, which aims to create cool looking floating islands, during my spare time and am still actively improving it constantly.
                <br>
                The core algorithm combines multiple layers of classical generation algorithms and components, such as Perlin noise or Marching Squares, with some custom additions to create some idyllic floating islands. Since I prefer creating assets myself, the range of environment objects is rather limited, but as time progresses I inted to add more variety. I also plan on using the tiled nature of the island later for buildings or perhaps even NPCs wandering it.
                <br>
                While the project currently does not have any proper gameplay, I am inclined towards adding it at a later point, however, only once I am satisfied with the island generation itself.

            <h2 class="caption">Bluetooth Dice</h2>
            <p>
                For this project I built upon an existing venture of the chair that aimed to create a digital version of the German board game "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%C3%A4rgere_Dich_nicht" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mensch ärgere Dich nicht</a>" (which is pretty similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ludo</a>). The original project digitized the entire board game and combined it with a server-based splitscreen functionality that would allow up to 4 devices (typically tablets) to be joined together into a single playing field. Later iterations added custom-made 3D-printed pawns/pieces that could be placed on top of the tablets and moved as if playing the classic version of the game. The tablets then registered these movements and applied them, if they were in accordance to the rules.
                <br>
                My job was to further integrate a previously created 3D-printed dice, which would communicate its results with the tablets using Bluetooth. The dice was based on an Arduino microcontroller and utilized gyroscopes to gather required data. In order to achieve my goal, I rewrote the dice-script and fully integrated the Bluetooth connection into the existing game project using Unity.

                For this project I revised and updated the code of a custom-made scale used by the FAR group for a cooperation project with various nursing homes. The purpose of the scale and its accompanying app was to track the hydration levels of the nursing homes' residents.
                <br>
                Using the app, nursing home staff members are capable of creating profiles for the separate residents. By linking different instances of the drinking gadgets to specific profiles, the daily drinking habits of the associated residents can be monitored. Each drinking gadget also contains a color sensor that can track stickers placed on the bottom of each glass or cup. Additionally, by associating each sticker color with a different type of liqiud, habits regarding specific drinks (e.g., water, milk, coffee) can be analyzed.
                <br>
                Lastly, I reworked the mentioned app and brought it up-to-date in terms of functionalities and stability.

                This project was a continuation of my Bachelor's Thesis. <a href="#project-bachelors-thesis">Click here to scroll down to part I.</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                After I had finished my Bachelor's Thesis I got hired by the FAR as a student assistant. I worked for the group during my entire Master's degree and got to work on many different interesting projects, one of which was the final development phase and release of my prior Bachelor's Thesis. Since then (almost 1.5 years later), quite a few plans had changed.
                <br>
                I adjusted the app to these new requirements and integrated all questions given to us by the numerous different subgroups of the enable-Cluster.
                While some things had to be changed, others stayed the same. Sadly most question types, the map integration as well as the leaderboard and even the AR-based questions had to go as the app's scope was redefined. As a replacement we would use QR codes, scanned from within the app to grant players access to the different booths' questions, combined with a physical booklet and stamps that would allow players to participate in an on-site lottery.
                Additionally some background info texts were included for interested participants and the admittedly sometimes rather rough UI was updated.
                <br>
                The final version was published on both the Google Playstore, as well as the iOS AppStore, and actively utilized during the aforementioned <a href="https://www.enable-cluster.de/innovationstag/fit-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freisinger Day of Innovation</a> (<a href="https://www.enable-cluster.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">english homepage of the enable Cluster, which sadly does not cover the FIT 2022</a>)

            <p>
                Undoubtedly, this was one of the more complex projects I worked on. It combined server-based Networking, VR and Webcam inputs to create an experience akin to an immersive simulation of a supermarket. This project was called into life way before I joined the research group with the goal of studying users' experience and behavior in such a situation. Utilizing a VR Headset, users are placed inside the supermarket and are tasked with retrieving specific goods. In order to find the goods, users are supported by a virtualized smartphone, which - depending on the mode - may be a livestreamed version of their own smartphone.
                <br>
                Of course, this complex system had multiple components which were developed by students writing their theses or other FAR members over multiple years. I mainly worked on three specific parts: Optimization, VR integration and Smartphone synchronization.
                <br>
                As I started working on the project, performance had greatly suffered from the years of continuous and incremental implementation. Even on the most performant settings, my somewhat decent PC was not able to push the project beyond 5-10 FPS. Over the course of a few weeks I applied as many optimizations as possible, reaching ~60 FPS even on the most demanding study setups. The VR integration and smartphone synchronization went hand-in-hand with each other. Together with another student assistant I debugged the different VR + smartphone setup modes to achieve a properly usable and enjoyable simulation experience.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Quite a mouthful - though not as bad as my Bachelor's Thesis, which you will find below ;)
                <br>
                I wrote this thesis at TUM's CAMPAR, namely for the FAR group
                <!-- <a href="https://www.campar.in.tum.de/Chair/ResearchAr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAR group</a>-->. While my Bachelor's Thesis topic was already put forward by the chair, I proposed this thesis myself. The idea for it came to me due to a number of reasons. For once, I wanted to work on a full game project myself, secondly, I also <i>really</i> like Norse mythology.
                <br>
                The proposal was accepted by the chair and I got to work. After some considerations, the project design was finalized. The backend of the game would be constructed in a fully modular fashion, allowing anyone proficient with C# and Unity to relatively easily add new myths, even from different mythologies. Afterwards, I would focus exclusively on a single myth from Norse mythology (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ragnarök</a>) in terms of implementation and Game Design.
                <br>
                The game would contain a "Codex" as a kind of library for interesting facts, objects, etc. as well as the main game part, that would be split into multiple sections, such as narrative-focused "Story segments", exploration-focused "Freewalk segments" (aka openly explorable environments) and action-focused "Combat segments". There would also be a framework to include various "Minigames", such as one similar to the card game "Concentration" (aka "Memory"), which would already be included as an implementation example.
                <br>
                Importantly, the game would also have to contain an Augmented Reality variant of almost each segment. I wrote this thesis at the "Forschungsgruppe Augmented Reality" ("Research Group Augmented Reality") after all. While AR is always an interesting topic, sadly the performance-wise more limited hardware forced me to cut down on certain parts I would have liked to cover with more visual fidelity.
                <br>
                After the few months of time for detailed design & implementation, I was ready to show the project to others. I presented the project both during one of the group's AR courses as well as to a general audience of TUM students, which were encouraged to try out the game. While there, of course, were a few things I would have liked to refine further, the project was all-around well received and was even able to capture quite a few people who had little to no prior interest in Norse mythology.

            <h2 class="caption">Bachelor's Thesis: Development of a Serious Game about Nutrition with Augmented Reality Features</h2>
            <p>
                Just as with my Master's Thesis, I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis at the CAMPAR chair of the TUM or more specifically the FAR group
                <!--<a href="https://www.campar.in.tum.de/Chair/ResearchAr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAR group</a>-->. Contrary to most other projects on this list, the game/gamification part of this thesis was rather slim. Instead it initially focused more on the overall amount of features and on creating an easily extendable framework.
                <br>
                The core gameplay idea was simple and case-driven: The enable-Cluster
                <!--<a href="https://www.enable-cluster.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enable-Cluster</a>-->, a German research group focusing on various nutrition- & food-based disciplines, required a quiz app for their upcoming participation at the "Freisinger Innovationstag" (FIT), an event-day all about nutrition in the German city of Freising. As part of the FAR group and enables' partnership, they were looking for a student to create this app in the scope of a thesis.
                <br>
                After various design iterations, my advisor and I settled on a split design, that would utilize two separate applications: The quiz app itself, as well as an editor that would allow anyone to easily create various types of quiz questions and deploy them with a single button press to all instances of said app, without needing to update the app in the various stores it would be published in. I got to work and implemented all discussed features until the end of the semester, meeting my submission deadline in time.
                <br>
                Overall this was an interesting experience, as it was the first time I actively worked for a "customer", with regular meetings between my advisor, representatives from the enable-Cluster and myself.
                <br>
                I can say with certainty I learned a lot about various programming concepts, APIs, and frameworks, such as asynchronous programming, realtime data transfer using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Firebase</a>, and even GPS visualizations via <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/unity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapbox's Unity SDK</a> or later <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/gaming/overview_musk?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps SDK for Unity</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                As part of my student assistant job, I later got to continue work on this project. <a href="#project-fit-app">Click here to scroll up to part II, in case you haven't seen it yet.</a>

                <br>
                Now you might think all was good and well, however, the last semester of my Bachelor's degree was during summer 2020. Yes, that summer. So the weeks came and went, but as lockdowns continued, it became apparent that the FIT would not be able to take place and thus my app not see the light of day within the foreseeable future...
                <br>
                A few months and ultimately well over a year passed, before I got to work on the project again. This time as part of my student assitant job at the FAR group. In the meantime, however, quite a few plans had changed. I adjusted the app to these new requirements and integrated all questions given to us by the numerous different subgroups of the enable-Cluster.
                <br>
                Some things had changed, others stayed the same: Some question types, the map integration as well as the leaderboard and even the AR-based questions had to go. As a replacement we would use QR codes, scanned from within the app to grant players access to the different booths' questions, combined with a physical booklet and stamps that would allow players to participate in an on-site lottery.
                <br>
                Additionally some background info texts were included for interested participants and the admittedly sometimes rather rough UI was updated.
                <br>
                The final version was published on both the Google Playstore, as well as the iOS AppStore.

            <h2 class="caption">The Facility</h2>

            <p>
                Since most of the projects I've worked on as a student or student assistant, except for my Master's Thesis, were either Gameplay or Tech-focused, it was refreshing to work on a more immersive and narrative experience. The player took on the role of a CEO's bodyguard sent into a research and development blacksite, owned by the CEO, in order to retrieve some top-secret documents. However, there were two main obstacles: On one hand, the facility had suffered a major containment breach only hours prior and now was swarming with monstrous creatures. On the other, the facility was located on a space station, which had automatically activated its self-destruct sequence as response to the breach.
                <br>
                The Facility is a first-person horror game and was created in a team of four, with each of us designing and building his very own level.
                My level were "The Sewers", a network of claustrophobic underground tunnels in which a worm-like monster stalked the player at every turn. While the first segment of the level was ominous and quiet, the second half was a much more stressful chase sequence in which the player would have to avoid the creature while finding their way through a maze-like pipe system.
                <br>
                I also really enjoyed the Gameplay development, which I did together with another group member, as it strayed away from the classic bird's-eye view/third-person-perspective I had used in many prior projects.

            <p>
                Probably one of my favourite Uni projects I've worked on. The player controls a small Icosphere and has to shoot down approaching enemies, consisting of cubes, tetrahedrons, and similar geometric shapes. As one can imagine, on its own this isn't the most complex or interesting gameplay idea. However, this game was developed as part of a course that was pretty much a semester-long GameJam with the topic "Chaos and Order". Our team of 3 came up with a unique concept: During the level the state of the environment would constantly swap between chaos and order. This resulted in a pretty interesting gameplay flow: While the player is in the order state, enemies are organized and attack in pre-defined formations. As soon as enemies enter the chaos state, they will move randomly and unpredictably. The player can attack enemies to destroy them during the order state, but has to use defensive weapons during the chaos state to survive the sudden onslaught. The world state itself constantly rotates, originating from the center of the arena.
                <br>
                Additionally the player can collect PowerUps to save themselves in difficult situations.
                <br>

            <h2 class="caption">Galaxy Simulation</h2>
            <p>
                This was the largest group project I participated in during my time at TUM. In a team of 8, we developed a galaxy simulation, that would see multiple interstellar races compete for dominance in a large procedurally generated galaxy with complex solar systems. As the goal was to primarily create a simulation, the project only had little actual gameplay, with only minor ways of influencing the different civilizations. A large part of the work was focused on detailed numerical values and calculations, such as traits of the different races and planets, as well as their interactions with factors such as population growth and expansion rates.
                <br>
                The core design of the project was heavily inspired by well-known Sci-Fi aspects, such as the Dark Forest theorem popularized by Liu Cixin's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Three-Body Problem</a> series, while visuals and aspects of the procedural generation drew from popular Sci-Fi games, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellaris_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellaris'</a> Galaxy Map.

                This project was a fun little bonus credits group project. While some parts of the UI design & graphics are arguably rough, this is one of the first goal-oriented projects I worked on. Most of my work went into the networking and basic gameplay aspects.
                <br>
                The gameplay is simple, yet enticing: In every match, two players compete against each other. The <i>Runner</i> has to survive in a 2D side-scrolling level with hazards and enemies, while the <i>Builder</i> attempts to actively kill the <i>Runner</i> by placing the levels components in the most difficult - yet possible - way.
                <br>
                The project was developed in Unity, using Firebase for networking.

                While the project looks somewhat questionable when it comes to graphics, I still think the core gameplay was pretty fun and unique. The nemesis system, which would actively encourage you to compete against other players, combined with the realtime PvP nature of the game made it enjoyable to play. Though, of course, as a small course project this was never published in any meaningful way, I learned a lot about networking and asynchronous programming here.

                This is the very first interesting project I worked on. As part of a course we course members implemented the different parts of this game on our own in 1-week-long sprints. Notably, however, we did not use any Game Engine, but rather wrote the entire game from the ground up using C++ and DirectX. This included everything from basic mesh rendering and lighting to enemy AI and gameplay features. While not the most visually stunning, I learned a great deal about low-level programming and rendering.
