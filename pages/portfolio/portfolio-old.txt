                During my studies and due to personal interest I have gathered experience in a wide variety of subjects
                related
                to IT and in particular Game Development & Design.

                            I've used it for most of my University and own projects, during the last few
                            years there
                            were only few weeks during which I didn't work with Unity

                            I've been regularly working with many different types of data files and
                            markup

                            During my studies, my communication skills and willingness for
                            teamwork
                            have
                            proven useful more than once to support and even lead student teams, resulting in multiple
                            successful final

                            As I've worked on complex subsystems and algorithms multiple times, I am
                            able to
                            easily understand difficult code and extract relevant information for my tasks.

                            During High School I passed the "Cambridge English: Advanced" (aka CAE or C1
                            Advanced)
                            exams with grade ###. Since then I have further improved my knowledge of the English language.

                            I've used it quite a bit for University courses and recently while learning more about

                            Solid understanding of rendering and related topics have helped me create
                            more
                            complex VFX for many of the projects I worked on

                            While I wouldn't called myself an artist, I have become proficient in using
                            both

                        <li>
                            <b>Git:</b>
                            Most of the team projects I've worked on required source control, which was usually
                            achieved
                            using
                            Git

                            Decent skills with these have helped me create this website. While this
                            website is
                            nothing special, I still had a lot of fun playing around with all the possibilities and trying many
                            different variations.

                            Sadly I did not get to use it for any University courses, though I am actively

                                picked
                                up quite a bit about it during University classes.

                <h2 class="caption">Bluetooth Dice</h2>
                <p>
                    For this project I built upon an existing project that aimed to create a digital version of the
                    German board game "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%C3%A4rgere_Dich_nicht"
                       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mensch ärgere Dich nicht</a>" (which is pretty similar
                    to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ludo</a>).
                    The original project digitized the entire board game and combined it with a server-based splitscreen
                    functionality that would allow up to 4 devices (typically tablets) to be joined together into a
                    single playing field. Later iterations added custom-made 3D-printed pawns/pieces that could be
                    placed on top of the tablets and moved as if playing the classic version of the game. The tablets
                    then registered these movements, if they were in accordance to the rules.
                    <br>
                    My job was to further integrate a previously created 3D dice, which would communicate its results
                    with the tablets using Bluetooth. The dice was based on an Arduino microcontroller and utilized
                    gyroscopes to gather required data. In order to achieve my goal, I rewrote the dice-script and fully
                    integrated the Bluetooth connection into the existing game project using Unity.

                <p>
                    Undoubtedly, this was one of the more complex projects I worked on. It combined server-based
                    Networking, VR and Webcam inputs to create an experience akin to an immersive simulation of a
                    supermarket. This project was called into life way before I joined the research group with the goal
                    of studying users' experience and behavior in such a situation. Utilizing a VR Headset, users are
                    placed inside the supermarket and are tasked with retrieving specific goods. In order to find the
                    goods, users are supported by a virtualized smartphone, which - depending on the mode - may be a
                    livestreamed version of their own smartphone.
                    <br>
                    Of course, this complex system had multiple components which were developed by students writing
                    their theses or other FAR members over multiple years. I mainly worked on three specific parts:
                    Optimization, VR integration and Smartphone synchronization.
                    <br>
                    As I started working on the project, performance had greatly suffered from the years of continuous
                    and incremental implementation. Even on the most performant settings, my somewhat decent PC was not
                    able to push the project beyond 5-10 FPS. Over the course of a few weeks I applied as many
                    optimizations as possible, reaching ~60 FPS even on the most demanding study setups. The VR
                    integration and smartphone synchronization went hand-in-hand with each other. Together with another
                    student assistant I debugged the different VR + smartphone setup modes to achieve a properly usable
                    and enjoyable simulation experience.

                    Mythology"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quite a mouthful - tho not as bad as my Bachelor's Thesis, which you will find below ;)
                    <br>I wrote this thesis at the CAMPAR chair of the TUM for the
                    <a href="https://www.campar.in.tum.de/Chair/ResearchAr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAR
                        group</a>.
                    While my Bachelor's Thesis topic was already put forward by the chair, I proposed this thesis
                    myself.
                    The idea for it came to me due to a number of reasons. For once, I wanted to work on a full game
                    project
                    myself, secondly, I also
                    <i>really</i>
                    like Norse mythology.
                    <br>The proposal was accepted by the chair and I got to work. After some considerations, the project
                    design
                    was finalized. The backend of the game would be constructed in a fully modular fashion and while I
                    focused
                    on a single myth from Norse mythology (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k" target="_blank"
                       rel="noopener noreferrer">Ragnarök</a>)
                    with the implementation and Game Design, the app should also be simple to expand further to include
                    other myths,
                    even from different mythologies.
                    <br>The game would contain a "Codex" as a kind of library for interesting facts, objects, etc. as
                    well
                    as the
                    main game part, that would be split into multiple sections, such as narrative-focused "Story
                    segments",
                    exploration-
                    focused "Freewalk segments" (aka open environments) and action-focused "Combat segments". There
                    would
                    also be
                    a framework to include various "Minigames", such as one similar to the card game "Concentration"
                    (aka
                    "Memory"),
                    which would already be included as an implementation example.
                    <br>Lastly, the game would also have to contain an Augmented Reality variant of almost each segment.
                    I
                    would
                    write this thesis at the "Forschungsgruppe Augmented Reality" ("research group AR") after all.
                    <br>After the few months of time for detailed design & implementation, I was ready to show the
                    project
                    to others.
                    I presented the project both during a specific AR course and to a general audience of TUM students,
                    which were
                    encouraged to try out the game. While there, of course, were a few things I would have liked to
                    refine
                    further,
                    the project was all-around well received and was even able to capture quite a few people who had
                    little
                    or no
                    prior interest in Norse mythology.

                    the German city of Freising. As part of the FAR group and enables' partnership, they were looking
                    for a
                    student
                    to create this app in the scope of a thesis.<br>After various design iterations, my advisor and I settled on
                    a split design, that would utilize
                    two separate applications: The quiz app itself, as well as an editor that would allow anyone to
                    easily
                    create various types
                    of quiz questions and transfer them with a single button press to all instances of said app.
                    I got to work and implemented all discussed features until the end of the semester, meeting my
                    submission deadline in time.<br>Overall this was an interesting experience, as it was the first time I
                    actively worked for a
                    "customer", with regular meetings
                    between my advisor, representatives from the enable-Cluster and myself.<br>I can say with certainty I
                    learned a lot about various programming concepts and apis &
                    frameworks,
                    such as
                    asynchronous programming, realtime data transfer using Google's Firebase, and GPS visualizations via<a

                    Now you might think all was good and well, however, the last semester of my Bachelor's degree
                    was during summer 2020. Yes, that summer. So the weeks came and went, but as lockdowns continued,
                    it became apparent that the FIT would not be able to take place and thus my app not see the light
                    of day within the foreseeable future...
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few months and ultimately well over a year passed, before I got to work on the project again.
                    This time as part of my student assitant job at the FAR group. In the meantime, however, quite a
                    few plans had changed. I adjusted the app to these new requirements and integrated all questions
                    given to us by the numerous different subgroups of the enable-Cluster.
                    <br>
                    Some things had changed, others stayed the same: Some question types, the map integration as well as the
                    leaderboard and even the AR-based questions had to go. As a replacement we would use
                    QR codes, scanned from within the app to grant players access to the different booths' questions, combined
                    with a physical booklet and stamps that would allow players to participate in an on-site
                    lottery.
                    <br>
                    Additionally some background info texts were included for interested participants and the
                    admittedly sometimes rather rough UI was updated.
                    <br>
                    The final version was published on both the Google Playstore, as well as the iOS AppStore.

                <h2 class="caption">Project: Equilibrium</h2>
                <p>Probably one of my favourite Uni projects I've worked on. The player controls a small Icosphere and
                    has to shoot down approaching enemies, consisting of cubes, tetrahedrons, and similar geometric
                    shapes.
                    As one can imagine, on its own this isn't the most complex or interesting gameplay idea.
                    However, this game was developed as part of a course that was pretty much a semester-long GameJam
                    with the topic "Chaos and Order". Our team of 3 came up with a unique concept: During the level the state
                    of the environment would constantly swap between chaos and order. This resulted in a pretty interesting
                    gameplay flow: While the player is in the order state, enemies are organized and attack in
                    pre-defined formations. As soon as enemies enter the chaos state, they will move randomly and unpredictably.
                    The player can attack enemies to destroy them during the order state, but has to use defensive
                    weapons during the chaos state to survive the sudden onslaught. The world state itself constantly rotates,
                    originating from the center of the arena.
                    <br>Additionally the player can collect PowerUps to save themselves
                    in difficult situations.<br>If you want to read more about this (or even play it), the<a

                <p>
                    This was the largest group project I participated in during my time at TUM. In a team of 8, we developed a galaxy simulation, that would see multiple interstellar races compete for dominance in a large procedurally generated galaxy with complex solar systems. As the goal was to primarily create a simulation, the project only had little actual gameplay, with only minor ways of influencing the different civilizations. A large part of the work was focused on detailed numerical values and calculations, such as traits of the different races and planets, as well as their interactions with factors such as population growth and expansion rates.
                    <br>
                    The core design of the project was heavily inspired by well-known Sci-Fi aspects, such as the Dark Forest theorem popularized by Liu Cixin's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Three-Body Problem</a> series, while visuals and aspects of the procedural generation drew from popular Sci-Fi games, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellaris_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellaris'</a> Galaxy Map.

                    This project was a fun little bonus credits group project. While some parts of the UI design & graphics are arguably rough, this is one of the first goal-oriented projects I worked on. Most of my work went into the networking and basic gameplay aspects.
                    <br>
                    The gameplay is simple, yet enticing: In every match, two players compete against each other. The <i>Runner</i> has to survive in a 2D side-scrolling level with hazards and enemies, while the <i>Builder</i> attempts to actively kill the <i>Runner</i> by placing the levels components in the most difficult - yet possible - way.
                    <br>
                    The project was developed in Unity, using Firebase for networking.

                    While the project looks somewhat questionable when it comes to graphics, I still think the core gameplay was pretty fun and unique. The nemesis system, which would actively encourage you to compete against other players, combined with the realtime PvP nature of the game made it enjoyable to play. Though, of course, as a small course project this was never published in any meaningful way, I learned a lot about networking and asynchronous programming here.

                    This is the very first interesting project I worked on. As part of a course we course members implemented the different parts of this game on our own in 1-week-long sprints. Notably, however, we did not use any Game Engine, but rather wrote the entire game from the ground up using C++ and DirectX. This included everything from basic mesh rendering and lighting to enemy AI and gameplay features. While not the most visually stunning, I learned a great deal about low-level programming and rendering.
